# Background

## Background

- There is a growing commitment in the UK and worldwide to rebalancing the travel system, so that more journeys are made using more active modes, such as walking and cycling.
- Walking and cycling are good for people's physical and mental health, but also, they reduce dependency on motorized transport, particularly cars, which will reduce noise and air pollution, reduce the risk of road traffic injury, and help cardiovascular diseasse and obesity.
- Therefore, there are significant population health gains to be made by moving people into more active modes of travel.
- Social norms, as well as system-based approaches, are understudied in public health. However, these could be key to understanding what makes an intervention successful.

## Model aims

- The aim is to build a configurable agent-based model of the *decision* to perform commuting behaviour.
- This means that the actual process of commuting is not modelled -- we don't model how traffic flows through cities.
- We look at the higher-level mode-choice decision rather than the act of travel.
- We aim to include the effect of the actions of peers and neighbours, subculture, habit, weather, bicycle ownership, car ownership, environmental supportiveness, and congestion on the decision to travel by walking, cycling, driving, or public transport.
- All the parameters are configurable allowing for other users to calibrate the model to their own area of interest.
